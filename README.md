## Application development structure

<h3>1. Navigation</h3>
The application is built with expo. It divides it into several main categories accessible by the user through a drawernavigator.
A stacknavigator allows to navigate between the different routes at the time of certain user choice.
The drawernavigator is encapsulated in a switchnavigator allowing the installation in the future of a connection interface.
